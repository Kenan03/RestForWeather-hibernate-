# RestForWeather-hibernate-
The Program is written in Java. He's allows you to receive weather data through a rest request 

I used:
- Servlet for to exchange information between the server and client parts of the program (HttpServlet)
- Jackson for serializing/deserializing Java objects into various text formats (ObjectMapper)
- Database postgreSQL
- Hibernate
